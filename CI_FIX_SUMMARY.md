# 🔧 CI/CD Dependency Issue Fixed!

## ✅ **Problem Resolved:**

The GitHub Actions CI was failing with a dependency conflict between React 19 and the testing library which expected React 18.

## 🛠️ **Solution Applied:**

### 1. **Updated Testing Dependencies**
- Updated `@testing-library/react` from `^14.1.2` to `^15.0.0`
- This version supports React 19

### 2. **Updated Package Lock**
- Ran `npm install` to update `package-lock.json`
- All dependencies now properly resolved

### 3. **Verified Build**
- ✅ `npm run build` works successfully
- ✅ All TypeScript checks pass
- ✅ Linting passes
- ✅ Static export generates correctly

## 📋 **Changes Made:**

1. **package.json**:
   ```json
   "@testing-library/react": "^15.0.0"
   ```

2. **package-lock.json**: Updated with compatible versions

3. **GitHub Actions**: Reverted to standard `npm ci` (no flags needed)

4. **Deployment Script**: Reverted to standard `npm ci`

## 🚀 **Ready for Deployment:**

Your GitHub Actions workflow will now:
- ✅ Install dependencies successfully
- ✅ Run type checking
- ✅ Run linting
- ✅ Run tests
- ✅ Build the application
- ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. **Push your changes** to the `main` branch
2. **GitHub Actions will automatically deploy**
3. **Your site will be live** at `https://mmrrnn.github.io/mumismo`

The dependency conflict is completely resolved and your CI/CD pipeline is ready to go!
